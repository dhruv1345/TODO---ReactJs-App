# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### **`npm start`**
- Runs the app in development mode.  
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
- The page will reload when you make changes.  
- You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### **`npm test`**
- Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
- See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

---

### **`npm run build`**
- Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
- It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
- The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.  
- Your app is ready to be deployed!  

Learn more in the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### **`npm run eject`**
> **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!  

- This command copies all configuration files and dependencies into your project.  
- It gives you full control but requires careful handling.  
- Use this only if the default configuration does not suit your needs.
